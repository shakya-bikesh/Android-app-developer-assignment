## Internship assignment for Android

### What you need to do?

* Take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) if you haven’t already.
* Create a private repo called “yipl-android-assignment” in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Do as instructed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple number of commits with proper messages) 
* Invite bikeshakya@gmail.com to that particular private repo

### Assignment

Implement a simple listing and detail showcase application using the following APIs:

* For listing: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/
* For details: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{id}/comments

Checkout [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for more details.

Once loaded, the data (both listing and detail) should persist. Any persistence mechanism can be used, i.e., cache or database. 

Design as you wish.

### Criteria for judgement

* Object Oriented approach used in project.
* Naming conventions for XML and Java files.
* Proper use of ViewGroup(s) and View(s).
* Proper use of Android API(s).
* Project structure.

### Bonus points

* Use of 3rd party libraries like [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) or any ORM libraries would be a big plus point.
* If you can use relevant 'Material Design' components in your application.
* If you write readme file with screenshots and short description of your application.
